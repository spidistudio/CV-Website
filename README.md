## About Me

This is my personal CV website, which showcases my experience working in this field. <br>
I started learning HTML at 11 years old, when I learned how to make a portofolio. Simple text, links to my Youtube and school. <br>
At 12 I started learning Python. At 13 I started learning C# and made some 3D computer and mobile games. <br>
At 14 I've started doing projects for other people using Python automation. <br>
Today, at 17 years old, I'm looking for more. More information. More knowledge. More experience. <br>
Any project, idea or script you want done, I am willing to do and learn how to improve.
